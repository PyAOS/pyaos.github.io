## Starting out

#### Workshops and short courses

If you're new to using Python for atmosphere and ocean science,
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and/or
[Unidata](https://unidata.github.io/python-training/) have got you covered. 

For those who have never used Python before,
Software Carpentry offer a single-day workshop on 
[Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/),
while Unidata's [Introduction to Python for Atmospheric Science and Meteorology](https://unidata.github.io/python-training/python/intro-to-python/)
has links to a bunch of useful lessons and resources.

For those who understand the basics of Python but are new to using it in the PyAOS context,
Data Carpentry offer a single-day workshop on 
[Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Science](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/),
while Unidata also run a [Python Workshop](https://unidata.github.io/python-training/workshop/workshop-intro/).

If there's not a Carpentries or Unidata workshop coming up soon in your area,
you can [request a Carpentries workshop](https://carpentries.org/workshops/).
Alternatively, you can work though the lesson materials online
for any of the workshops listed above.


#### Books and university courses

If you're looking for something longer than a single-day workshop,
check out the following
(listed in approximate order from beginner to more advanced):  
* [Python Programming and Visualization for Scientists](https://sundogpublishingstore.myshopify.com/products/python-programming-and-visualization-for-scientists-2nd-ed) is a general introudction to Python for scientists,
but some of the plotting and data examples have a meteorological slant
because both the authors (Alex DeCaria and Grant Petty) are professors in meteorology.
* [Project Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/)
is a community learning resource for Python-based computing in the geosciences.
* [Python for the Geosciences](https://github.com/kthyng/python4geosciences)
is an open source semester-long class offered by the Oceanography Department at Texas A&M University.
* [Earth Observation Using Python: A Practical Programming Guide](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119606925) is a book from atmospheric scientist Rebekah Esmaili, focused on using Python to analyze environmental satellite data.
* [Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io)
is an open source book from oceanographers Ryan Abernathy and Kerry Key,
which grew out of a semester-long class at Columbia University.
* [Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/)
is an open source book from a group of Carpentries instructors,
including climate scientist Damien Irving.


## Additional resources

The [Pythia Resource Gallery](https://projectpythia.org/gallery.html)
provides links to additional workshops, tutorials, books and courses
relevant to the wider geoscience discipline.
