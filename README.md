## Contributing

#### Changes to existing pages
The content for each page of the website exists as a markdown file in the root directory.
Contributors are encouraged to submit pull requests with suggested changes to those markdown files.
Those less familiar with GitHub can instead create a new [issue](https://github.com/PyAOS/pyaos.github.io/issues).

> **Previewing your changes**  
> If you'd like to preview how your changes will look on the web before submitting a pull request,
> run `jekyll serve` in the root directory of your forked repository.
> Installation instructions for Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

#### Adding new pages and/or making changes to website layout
New pages can be added using `default.md` as a template.
The new page will then need to be referenced in `_config.yml` and `index.md`.
The [Doks documentation](https://doks.themejack.com/blue/) provides more details if required.
